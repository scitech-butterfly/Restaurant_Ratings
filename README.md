<h1> Restaurant Ratings </h1>
<h3> Author: Kashvi Singh </h3>

<h7> Language Used: Python </h7>
<p> In this project, we explore a dataset of Zomato restaurants in Bangalore(obtained from Kaggle) and analyze the factors affecting the ratings of each restaurant.</p>
<p> We start by preparing the dataset and replacing the null values by the median value of the column for easy computations. </p>
<p>Next, we have developed a filtering based recommendation system, which takes the choice of cuisine and the cost from the user and suggests the top 15 restaurants with the highest ratings, matching the criteria. </p>
<h5>Machine Learning Model</h5>
<p>We have trained an ML model to predict the ratings of restaurants based on 5 features:</p>
<li>Average Cost for Two People </li>
<li>Online Ordering Facility</li>
<li>Table Booking Facility</li>
<li>Cuisine Type</li>
<li>Rating(Out of 5)</li>
