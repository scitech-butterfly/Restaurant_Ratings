<h1> Restaurant Ratings </h1>
<h3> Author: Kashvi Singh </h3>

<h7> Language Used: Python </h7>
<p> In this project, we explore a dataset of Zomato restaurants in Bangalore(obtained from Kaggle) and analyze the factors affecting the ratings of each restaurant.</p>
<p> We start by preprocessing the dataset, performing imputations, normalization, encoding, and dealing with outliers. </p>
<p>Next, we have developed a filtering based recommendation system integrating Power BI, which takes the choice of cuisine and the cost from the user and suggests the top 15 restaurants with the highest ratings, matching the criteria. </p>
<h5>Machine Learning Model</h5>
<p>We have trained an ML model using Random Forest Classifier to predict the ratings of restaurants based on the following features:</p>
<li>Average Cost for Two People </li>
<li>Online Ordering Facility</li>
<li>Table Booking Facility</li>
<li>Cuisine Type</li>
<li>Rating(Out of 5)</li>
<p>This project was a deep-dive into the basics of <u>data preprocessing</u> and <u>exploratory data analysis,</u> followed by <u>Machine Learning using Python</u> and integrating a real-time project with <u>PowerBI</u>. </p>
